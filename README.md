# tasty.co-recipe-insights

This project was created to find insights and patterns on recipes from the tasty.co website. 


# Project overview 

1. Python scripts, `tastyreciplistscrap.py` and `tastyrecipescrape.py`, were used to scrape pertinent information on recipes.
2. Data was organized and prepared for SQL with the jupyter notebook, `Cleaning and File Management for Webscraping.ipynb`.
3. Data was thoroughly cleaned and explored in the SQL file, `tastySQL.sql`.
4. Finally, a dashboard was created using tableau to view the insights on the recipes. This can be viewed under the tableau workbook, `Tasty.co Recipe Insights.twbx`, 
or through the tableau public url: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joe.bui/viz/Tasty_coRecipeInsights/Insights
